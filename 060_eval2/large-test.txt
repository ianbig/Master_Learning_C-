HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

vI can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

vI can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

vI can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

HIGH SCHOOL—SOPHOMORE Year

“I’ll pay you fifty bucks to write my English paper.”

I slam my locker shut before shifting to face the brave soul who asked that.

I don’t cheat.

I don’t break rules.

Everyone knows this.

He’s casually leaning against the locker next to mine. A smirk is spread across his face, as if he expects me to squeal in delight that he’s asking me for a favor.

Not happening, homeboy.

Homeboy is Rex Lane.

Our school’s arrogant fuckboy.

A guy I’m not writing a paper for.

I mock his smile. “I’ll charge you fifty bucks not to rat you out for homework bribery.”

“Homework bribery?” He flashes a brighter I’m a nice guy; do what I’m asking grin.

I firmly nod. “Yes.” I motion down the hallway. “Now, go away. Having this stupid conversation with you is wasting my valuable study time.”

I count on my rudeness to scare him off, but when his eyes brighten in amusement, I know I’m wrong.

Crap.

I have two high school goals in life:

Become class valedictorian.
Do not gain Rex’s or any popular guy’s attention.
Luckily, he caught me after the class bell rang, so no one is around to witness this unfortunate encounter.
“Come on, Carolina,” he pleads. “Prove to me the rumors about you aren’t true.”

I stiffen. “Rumors?” I deliver a stern look. “What rumors?”

I mind my business. Don’t gossip. Stay in my lane.

All of this to prevent rumors from circulating about me.

He licks his lips, leaning in closer, and lowers his voice. “The rumors that you have a stick up your ass and lack personality.”

This jerk.

There might be a stick up my ass, but I’m going to shove my foot up his.

I narrow my eyes, and my response releases in a hiss, “Really? You want to talk about rumors? Maybe I should believe the rumors about you.”

“The rumors that say I’m cool as fuck? A terrific lay? Fucking hilarious?”

Our high school halls flood with rumors about him.

The one that he sports an overinflated ego is officially confirmed.

“Negative,” I reply. “The rumors that you’re a sucky lay with a small penis.”

This is a lie—a rumor I’ve never heard—but hey, if he wants to talk crap, so can I.

“Lies, babe, all lies. I’m more than happy to present the evidence to back up my claim.” He retreats a step, dropping his hand to the crotch of his jeans, and tugs at his zipper.

I do another quick scan of the hallway before loudly snorting. “You won’t do it.”

He flinches, that smug smile slipping off his lips. “Huh?”

“You won’t do it.” I nod toward his crotch. “You won’t unzip your pants and present your evidence.” I park my hands on my waist and kick my foot out.

He gapes at me, speechless.

“Pull it out or go away.” I dismissively wave my hand. “I have a test in ten minutes, and you, standing in front of me with your hand on your junk, aren’t helping me ace it. Go beg another girl to write your paper because you lack a brain … and according to the girls’ locker room gossip, a decent penis size.”

He drops his hand from his crotch, his smile returning. “Looks like Little Miss Innocent might not be as uptight as she leads on. There’s some personality hidden underneath those awful, itchy-looking sweaters of yours.” He makes a show of eyeing me up and down.

I opt out of giving him hell over the uptight comment. The faster he goes away, the better.

“No, she has a low annoyance tolerance.”

He steeples his hands into a praying motion. “Say yes to writing my paper, and then you can go about your studying, sweater-wearing ways.”

“No.”
“Sixty bucks and a bonus of proving I’m well-endowed when we’re in private.”

I dramatically gag. “Gross.” As much as I don’t want to deal with him, I could use the cash. “Seventy-five, and I’ll help you write the paper, but you’re doing it yourself. I don’t cheat.” I signal to his jeans. “And keep your micropenis to yourself. I’d rather fail every class than have you prove you’re well-endowed.”

“Paying you to help me write the paper defeats the point of paying you.”

“Really? With that brilliance of yours, you shouldn’t need me to write your paper.”

He laughs.

“Why are you even asking me? You’re in line—behind me—to be class valedictorian. You can easily write your own paper.” I reach forward to pat his shoulder. “I have faith in you, petite-penis buddy.”

“Never said I couldn’t write the boring-ass paper. I’d just rather not. I’m a busy guy who doesn’t give two shits about Shakespeare.”

“Eighty dollars,” I blurt out.

“Eighty? What the fuck? You can’t up the ante like that.”

“I can, and the longer you waste my time, the higher the price.” I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, but hey, money talks. “Eighty dollars. Meet me at the library after school.”

“The library sucks. My house.”

I shake my head. “You’re high if you think I’m going to your house.”

“If I’m paying eighty dollars, which is fucking insane, at least give a guy the privacy of his own home.”

I thrust my finger toward him. “You’d better not try any funny business.”

He rubs his palms together. “This is homework, Carolina. Get your virginal mind out of the gutter.”

MY LAST CLASS of the day is AP English.

It’s also Rex’s.

This gives him the opportunity to stalk me out of class, to my locker, and out to the parking lot while I ignore him.

Classmates call out his name, give him head nods, and say hi as we pass them. Interest floods their faces when their eyes cut to me. It’s not that I’m the class weirdo—although, as I learned today, I apparently have a stick up my ass.

High school kids are so original.

I’m more along the lines of the class do-gooder who aces every test and spendsher free time volunteering.

Oh, and I’m also the preacher’s daughter.

Rex definitely isn’t preacher’s daughter’s friend material.

Hell, he doesn’t even fit into his role of the mayor’s son.

“Where’s your car?” he asks, strolling next to me and scanning the parking lot.

I look away, embarrassment striking me. “I don’t have one.”

My parents gave me the option of waiting until my sister graduated and passing her car down to me or buying one myself. Considering my cash flow is zilch, waiting for hers it is.

A whiff of fresh soap and citrus hits me when he slings his arm over my shoulders.

“You ride the bus?”

I shift out of his hold. “I ride with my sister.”

“Tell her you don’t need a ride today.” He returns his arm to my shoulders and spins us toward the opposite side of the parking lot. “Today is your lucky day, sweetheart. You get to ride with me.”

“Hard pass.” Surprisingly, I don’t shove him away while he leads me to a newer model black Dodge Challenger.

“Come on, Lina. It’d be pretty selfish to have your sister drive you when you could ride with me.”

“Don’t call me that,” I grumble.

His arm falls, and he ups his pace to turn around and stare at me, walking backward. “What?”

“Lina. No one calls me that.” I immediately regret telling him this.

He rubs his thumb over his bottom lip. “I’m for fucking sure calling you Lina now. It’ll be our thing, babe.”

“Ugh, and don’t call me babe either.”

“Lina babe, when you tell me not to do something, it only makes me want to do it more.”

“Then, it’s only fair for me to give you a nickname.” I tap my finger against the side of my mouth. “I’m going with … Needle Dick.” There’s no stopping my lips from cracking into a smile.

He points at the car. “Get your ridiculous nickname-giving ass into my car and stop insulting my dick before I really do show you.”

“You’ve already proven you’re too chicken in the hallway.”

“Of course, I can’t pull my dick out at school. My parents would kill me if I got caught showing off my cock like I was at the school’s talent show.”I snort. “That would require you to have talent.”

He smirks. “Oh, babe, I have plenty of talents. My first trick will be to show you how to pull that stick out of your ass.”

“So I can stick it up yours?”

“I like this little attitude of yours. It’s hot.”

He digs out his keys from the pocket of his jeans and unlocks the car. I hop into the passenger seat with no argument. He’s right. Not only would my sister bitch on the entire drive to Rex’s, but she’d also charge me gas money for having to go out of her way.

I settle into the leather seat while Rex pulls out of the parking lot. He thrums his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of a Snoop Dogg song. I use this chance to take in everything that is him.

What’s fascinating about Rex is, he’s not your typical popular guy—the ones you see in movies and read about in books. He’s not the star athlete or the prom king or the school’s notorious bad boy. His personality is what draws people to him. He’s fun, cocky, and laid-back. Everyone either wants to be his friend or his girlfriend.

That is, everyone except yours truly.

I don’t need that kind of distraction in my life.

Rex is also crazy smart. He spends most of his time in the computer programming lab and has even been called into the school office to fix technical issues. Rumor has it, he’s also hacked into the system before.

He’s tall, at least six feet, and he towered over my small frame when we walked through the parking lot. He might not play sports, but he’s more toned than our quarterback. His hair is a coppery-brown and cut short. Two dimples pop out of his cheeks when he smiles, and the asymmetry of his face is flawless.

He’s also rich. I’m reminded of this when he pulls into the driveway of his mansion of a home. It’s the biggest in their neighborhood, and it has a giant yard and impeccable landscaping. The Lane family is considered the most affluent in our small town of Blue Beech, Iowa.

Rex shifts the car into park and steals my attention from the home when he clears his throat. “That sure was a fun ride. I’ve never been checked out by a preacher’s daughter before.”

My eyes widen.

Oh dear God.

Was I that obvious?

“That’s it. Take me home,” I demand. “I don’t check out guys. I was simply observing the guy I’m going to be stuck with for the next few hours.”“Too late. We have a paper to write, Lina babe.”

He kills the engine to the car, circles it, and opens my door as I’m debating my next move.

Go in or leave.

I smack away his waiting hand, and he moves out of the way. With a scoff, I follow him into the house. As soon as we make it through the front door, he captures my hand in his, and I nearly fall on my face when he starts pulling me up the stairs.

“My bedroom is up here,” he says.

I jerk back, causing him to stop. “I’m not going into your bedroom.”

He glances back at me, blinking. “Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m—”

I’m cut off when he grabs my hand again, tightening his grip, and stupidly, I don’t fight him this time. He steers us down a long hallway and into a bedroom.

It’s a spacious room, larger than my parents’ master, and surprisingly clean. Three of the walls are painted a dark red, and the other is black. Against the black wall is a sleek metal bed with a black comforter on top. It’s different than any guy’s room I’ve seen before.

Granted, I normally don’t hang out in guys’ bedrooms.

There’s a mini fridge in the corner, a massive desk with three monitors on top, and a TV above a black console. A collection of gaming devices and games clutter the stand.

I lose his hold when he shuts the door behind us.

“Seriously?” I snap, crossing my arms. “You have no boundaries.”

He grins, showing off his bright white teeth. “My mom said that can be a great trait in life.”

“For who? Serial killers?”

“For guys asking girls to do their homework.”

He walks around me to the mini fridge, opens it, and peeks up at me. “What’s your drink of choice, Lina? Water? Pepsi? Tequila?”

I roll my eyes, pushing my black-rimmed glasses up my nose. “You don’t have tequila in there.” This calling-his-bluff game is fun.

“I beg to differ.” He clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “It’s in a Gatorade bottle, tucked into the very back so no one sees it.”

Yeah, right.

Today, I’m feeling gutsy.

“Give me a tequila shot then.”

He squints in my direction. “You’re fucking with me.”I shake my head. “I’ll need it to get through an afternoon of hanging out with you.”

He grins, pushing his arm into the fridge, and pulls out a bottle.

Maybe calling his bluff wasn’t the smartest idea.

We’re not at school where he can be expelled for doing something like this.

We’re in his bedroom.

I gulp when I see the bottle, focusing on the amber-tinted liquid inside that’s most definitely not Gatorade.

Way to call his bluff, Carolina.

Now, he’s calling yours.

Time to gear up and taste tequila for the first time.

The room is quiet as he stands. His eyes are fastened on me while he slowly unscrews the orange cap and holds the bottle out to me.

I’ll be damned if I let him win this … game? Whatever it is.

Nausea cartwheels in my stomach, and I haven’t even taken a drink. Lord knows how it’ll feel after I do. I inhale a deep, determined breath.

I got this.

I’ve never drunk tequila, but I’ve had wine.

It can’t be that different, right?

Deciding it’s done doing gymnastics, my stomach tightens, as if it’s preparing itself, when I snatch the bottle from him. I grip it and drag it to my lips. Right before I do anything drastic, my back stiffens, and I frown at the same time.

“How many people have taken a drink from this bottle?” I question. “I’m not about to contract some STD.”

He chuckles, signaling to the bottle. “The only person who’s drunk from that bottle is me.” He pauses, snaps his fingers, and points at me. “And you, in a minute.”

I narrow my eyes at him. “You better not be lying.”

His hands go to his chest, feigning offense. “Lina, my sweet Lina, I’m heartbroken you don’t trust me.”

I gulp again.

Here goes nothing.

I can do this.

Before I chicken out, I take a quick swig of the tequila. My eyes slam shut, blocking me from witnessing his reaction, and my teeth clench as I swallow down the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted. There’s no stopping my body from shuddering. I hold in a deep breath out of fear of puking it up.

When I open my eyes, I immediately roll them.A huge grin is spread across Rex’s shocked face.

He whistles and leans back on his heels. “Damn, Lina. Either you have a secret wild side, which I’d fucking love, or I’m bringing it out of you, which I’d also fucking love.”

I shrug. “You’ll never know.”

I inhale a deep breath, dragging up as much nerve as I can, and take another sip to prove myself. My throat burns as if it were on fire, and I smile with pride as soon as I swallow it down.

“It’s your turn, Needle Dick.” I extend the bottle back to him.

“Look at me, corrupting you.” He grabs it, cheers me, and takes a gulp. “I can’t wait to do it more.”

Little do I know, walking into Rex’s bedroom will change everything.

Rex Lane will take over my life.

He’ll steal my heart.

I’ll steal his.

Only we won’t know what to do with what we’ve taken.HIGH SCHOOL—JUNIOR Year

“Yo, Lane, I need a favor,” Murphy calls out, slapping me on the back while strolling past me in the guys’ locker room.

I tug on my T-shirt. “What’s up?”

He stops at a locker a few down from mine, opens it, and turns my way. “Put in a good word for me with Carolina.” A sly grin passes over his flushed, freckled face. Dude was struggling to hit twenty push-ups in gym class earlier. “You two are tight and all, right?”

A sour taste fills my mouth. Carolina Adams has always stayed in her own withdrawn world, but little by little, I’ve been tugging her into mine. That tugging has shone attention on her since we spend so much time together. That’s when I want to push her back into her world, away from the just-surpassed-puberty douche bags like Murphy.

“Sorry, dude. I have no good words to say,” I answer with a shrug.

He groans, throwing his head back. “Come on. Do your boy a favor.”

Murphy is not my boy. The only time I’ve been around him outside of school is in passing at parties. He’s a lightweight who brags and lies about hooking up with girls. No way in hell am I letting him near Carolina.

“Why do you want me to lie to her?”

He produces an overeager smile. “I’m asking her to prom.”

The fuck he is.

“No, you’re not,” I say with warning.

“Yes, I am,” he fires back, irritation growing in his tone.

“She already has a date. Me. Ask someone else.”

I snatch my bag from the bench and walk away without a backward glance. When I’m in the hall, I drag my phone from my back pocket, open my texts, and hit Carolina’s name.Correction: the name she changed her contact to.

Me: Meet me at my car after school. I’m taking you home.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Okay, Mr. Bossy. What’s up?

Me: It’s too much to text. My fingers hurt. They had quite the workout last night.

The Smartest and Coolest Girl in the World: Gross. If you meant for that to be a sex joke, it was weak sauce.

I can’t help but chuckle.

Me: See you at my car, you pain in the ass.

A YEAR HAS PASSED since Carolina helped me write my paper.

Help meaning, we put off writing it and hung out instead. We watched TV. I taught her how to play my favorite video games, and we ate as if we were on death row and it was our last dinner.

Day after day, we hung out with the intention of writing that dumbass paper. I ended up writing it myself in twenty minutes and still scored an A.

Who said doing shit half-assed never got anyone anywhere?

After I turned in the paper, we kept hanging out, and somehow, we became friends—which was a fucking shock to us and everyone. She introduced me to chick flicks, and I introduced her to a thing called having fun—like taking her to parties, where she wasn’t allowed to leave my side. I’ve brought her out of her shell, and she’s calmed me.

Somehow, in some-fucking-way, we click.

I’m a dude who doesn’t want to get in her panties.

She’s a chick who doesn’t want to bang me.

There are no expectations between us.

We study. Watch movies. Go out for pizza.

She has dinner at my house at least two nights a week.

My mom fucking loves her.

Her parents, however, aren’t my biggest fans, but they keep their mouths shut because my family donates a shit-ton of money to her father’s church. Carolina hasn’t been banned from hanging out with me yet, but that doesn’t mean Pastor Adams hasn’t attempted to sway her view of me.

I grin when I find her at my car with a stack of books balanced in her arms. She’s wearing one of her signature sweaters, skinny jeans, and flats that tie up to herankles. The sweater looks itchy and is ugly as hell, but I’ve learned to love them. A string of fake pearls lines her neck, and her deep black hair is straight, hitting her shoulders.

“What was so important that you had to text me during class?” she snaps when I reach her. “Mrs. Heath confiscated my phone in front of everyone and wrote me a warning.”

“Screw Mrs. Heath.” I grab her books from her arms. “Tell her you’re my best friend next time she pulls that shit. Guarantee she’ll hand it back in seconds.”

“What does that mean?” She scrunches up her nose. “Your family might be the Kennedys of Blue Beech, but I’d suggest you calm that ego down, good sir.” She turns around and gets into the Charger while I toss her books into the back seat before getting into the driver’s side.

“It means, Mrs. Heath attempted to confiscate my phone once. I made a compelling argument. She gave it back. Not to sound like a dick, but she’s scared of me.”

“Uh, that does make you sound like a dick.”

I shrug, starting the car.

“Are you going to tell me what your compelling argument was?” She makes a sour face. “God, please tell me you didn’t sleep with her. She’s married and as old as your mom!”

“Hell no. Married cougars aren’t my type. They tend to be too bossy. All I simply said was, I was sure her husband would love to know what her favorite after-school activity was.”

“Which is?” She cocks her head to the side. “Isn’t she the tennis coach?”

“She’s bumping uglies with the PE teacher.”

“Gross.” She sticks out her tongue. “Doesn’t he have a wife and, like, five kids?”

I nod. “Sure does.”

“How do you always know these things? You know everyone’s business.”

I shrug. “I watch people. I pay attention. Not to mention, I work on the school’s cameras sometimes.” I poke her shoulder. “Don’t think I haven’t seen Clint Evans stopping by your locker between periods.”

Her eyes widen, a blush rising up her cheeks, and she shoves my side. “Oh my God! You spy on me?”

“Nope.” I struggle to fight back a smile. “I’m making sure the school is a safe environment for my fellow peers to learn.”

“I’m so sure that’s where your concern is.”

“And not to put poor little Clint on blast, but dude calls his mother mommy when they’re on the phone.” I exaggeratedly shudder. “Some weird shit there. I wouldn’ttake on that kid.”

“You’re seriously terrible, you know that?” Her lips twitch into a smile. “Don’t pick on Clint for being a mommy’s boy when I’m sure you have no problem with girls being daddy’s girls.”

“Oh, man, you set yourself up for this one. For your information, I do dislike chicks calling their fathers daddy because it’s what I prefer they call me in the bedroom.”

She shoves my shoulder. “I don’t know why I talk to you.”

"I’m your favorite person in the world, that’s why.” I shake my head, clapping my hands. “Now, let’s step away from the daddy talk and move on to serious business. Grab your planner, sweetheart. Pencil me in to pick you up three Saturdays from now. Seven o’clock.”

“Okay,” she drags out. “What’s up with the preplanning?”

“Prom night. Let me know the color of your dress, so we can do all that matchy-matchy bullshit.”

“Excuse me?” She scowls in my direction. “You can’t just tell me I’m going to prom with you.” She throws her arms up, her voice nearing hysteria, like the boring romance movies she forces me to watch. “You didn’t even ask!”

“No need for me to ask. You’re going to prom with me.”

“What if I don’t want to go with you? You didn’t even give me a promposal!”

“Tough shit. You won’t find a better date. Not to mention, I’m the only guy in this school who won’t try to weasel his inexperienced dick into your virginal panties.” He raises his brows. “If you want a promposal, I’ll get one of those banners that fly in the sky or some shit.”

“You’re so romantic.” She crosses her arms, pouting her glossy pink lips. “Have you ever thought that I don’t want my panties to stay virginal? Maybe I want to change that on prom night.”

“Maybe you’ve lost your goddamn mind.” I clear my throat, and my voice grows deeper. “You’re my date. Your panties will remain untouched.” I jerk my thumb toward her planner in the back seat. “Put it in there, circle it with a red marker, and don’t forget.”

She huffs. “What about Leanne, the girl you’ve already asked to prom?”

Shit. I fucking forgot about Leanne. “She can either be your sister-date or kick rocks.”

“I am not having a sister-date!” she shrieks.

“Looks like she’ll be kicking rocks then. I’ll bribe her to go with someone else.”

Murphy is available.

“I can’t believe I speak to you.”“You. Me. Prom.” I lean over and kiss her cheek. “My mom is making tacos tonight. You coming over for dinner?”

“Ugh, fine, but I’m only coming for her and the tacos.”HIGH SCHOOL—SENIOR Year

I pause my game at the sound of a knock on my bedroom door.

“Come in,” I call out.

When the door opens, I expect to find my mom, asking for dirty laundry or if I’ve decided on which college I’m going to attend.

Nope and nope.

My back straightens in my chair when Carolina walks in.

Relief settles inside me. Lately, she’s been distant, blaming it on finals, scholarships, and college acceptance letters. I have no doubt she’s stressed. Her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect, and it pisses me off.

I blink, adjusting my eyes to her in the faint light coming from my desk lamp, as she shuts the door.

“Did you try to call?” I ask, tossing the controller in my hand to the side.

She shakes her head, and my stomach drops as I focus on her. She reminds me of a nervous cub who lost her mother as she fidgets with her bracelet and then her earrings and then pulls at the end of her ponytail.

The fuck?

I stand from my chair. “Is everything okay?”

Her fidgeting stops as she draws in a breath and plays with the button of her sweater. “I want you to take my virginity.” The words fall from her mouth so casually, like she’s asking me to watch a movie, not confiscate her fucking V-card.

There’s no stopping the laughter that rolls out of me. “Good one.”

She shoots me a frustrated glare. “I’m serious. I want you to take my virginity. Tonight.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “Quit fucking with me.”

We’ve talked about her virginity—mainly me teasing and telling her to keep it forever—but she’s never suggested I take the damn thing before. She’s either messingwith me or lost her mind.

Conversation change, pronto.

“Want to order a pizza? Watch a movie?”

“Screw pizza,” she snaps. “I’m not going to college a virgin.”

“Why not? You should stay a virgin forever.”

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I haven’t imagined having sex with Carolina. I’ve imagined sex with her a fucking lot.

In the shower with my hand on my cock.

In bed with my hand on my cock.

When we’re hanging out and I have to fight to keep from getting hard.

It wasn’t like that in the beginning. Sure, I thought she was cute, but I only saw her as a friend. As we grew closer and older, my attraction developed. Everything about Carolina is perfect. She has the biggest heart I’ve ever known, and once you cut through her shyness, she’s pretty funny. She’s too gorgeous for her own damn good—a one-of-a-kind beauty hiding behind her glasses and sweaters.

I’ve come to love those damn sweaters.

Bought her two for Christmas.

No lie, I’d love to throw her on my bed and give her what she’s asking.

But I can’t.

Sleeping with Carolina is a line I’ll never cross.

She’s my person.

She knows me better than anyone, and I’ll be damned if I give that up to temporarily get my dick wet.

“I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’ve made my decision.” She exhales a sharp breath. “I don’t want it to be with some random guy, and I trust you more than anyone, Rex.”

I clench my fists, standing only inches from her.

How can she come here and ask me that?

How can she put me in this position?

“I’m not taking your virginity.” My tone is sharp. My body is tense.

“Fine.” Her tone mimics mine. “I’ll find someone else to take it.”

I grind my teeth when she turns to leave, and I move faster than I ever have before in my life. I catch her elbow, hauling her deeper into my bedroom and away from the door.

I tilt my head down, glaring at her while my hand is still latched on to her elbow, and my lips meet her ear as I speak. “Don’t do this. Don’t be stupid.”

“Do what I’m asking then.”“No,” I bite out.

She jerks out of my hold and pushes my chest. “Why?” she hisses. “You screw girls on the regular. It’s nothing out of the ordinary for you—rinse, wash, repeat. Act like I’m a random girl you’ve texted for a week and met up with at a party to bang.”

“You’re not some random girl I’ve texted for a week.” You’re everything to me.

She’s also fucking insane. Carolina has officially lost her goddamn mind.

She quietly stares at me for a moment.

Thank fuck.

I think I’ve won this … talk, argument, whatever the fuck it is.

She proves me wrong when she falls back a step and starts unbuttoning her sweater.

Motherfucker.

“Carolina,” I warn.

She ignores me, and the sweater falls to her feet, giving me the sight of her chest in only a plain black bra. I lose a breath, my heart beating wildly, and my stomach knots in nervousness. Just as I’m about to bend down and scoop up her sweater to hand it back, I stop.

I’m frozen in place as she unbuttons her jeans.

“Carolina,” I warn again, this time harsher.

I hate that my dick twitches as I eye her. I cover my crotch with my palm, mentally telling it to calm down.

I’m not being very persuasive.

To neither it nor Carolina.

“Rex,” she says, mimicking my tone again. “Do it, or I’ll find someone else.”

My nostrils flare at the thought of someone else doing it. My bedroom seems ten times smaller as we stare at each other.

Her breathing is heavy.

Mine is deep.

She’s waiting for me to give her what she wants.

I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

She won’t change her mind.

I know Carolina, and I know when she’s determined. This is determined Carolina.

I’ve never seen her so determined in her life.

I’m so fucked.

She tilts her head to the side. “So … can we start now?”

Jesus.

“I don’t want this to come between us,” I croak out.

“It won’t. We’ll act like it never happened.” She’s so damn sure of herself.

“Why are we doing it then?”

She shrugs, and I scrub a hand over my face when she unzips her jeans.

Nervous of falling on my ass, I sit on the edge of my bed. My eyes fasten to her as she wiggles out of her jeans, and I gulp at the reveal of her black boy shorts. I’ve seen her in a bikini plenty of times when she’s come over to swim. It’s hard, but I’ve always done a decent job of not gawking at her.

It’s more intimate in here than in my backyard.

We’re in my bedroom. She’s stripping in front of me.

And she looks fucking breathtaking.

I can’t help myself from taking in every inch of her. Her skin is tan. Her straight hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, showing off the perfect angles of her face. Since the light is limited, I can’t see as much as I’d like, but I see enough to want more of her. Her breasts are full, and I eye her curves, unable to stop myself from running my tongue along my bottom lip.

“Please, Rex,” she whispers. “Do it for me.”

We don’t mutter a word when I stand. I keep a safe distance between us as I try to figure out a plan.

We’re doing this.

Having sex.

I’m going to take my best friend’s virginity.

My heart pounds as I clear my throat. “I’m not sure how to even start this.”

Why do I feel like the virgin here?

“Do whatever you normally do,” she says with confidence, as if I were the one losing my virginity. “Part A goes into Part B.” One of her hands forms an O while she sticks a finger through it with the other. “We both took sex ed.”

“Okay, let’s not refer to sex like we’re following directions to assemble furniture.” I draw in a nervous breath. “And if I do what I normally do, it’ll get more intimate. I don’t just stick Part A into Part B.”

She flinches, her lips forming an O, similar to what her hand did. “Oh.”

She takes small steps backward to my bed, throws back the comforter, and slips underneath the sheets. I’m speechless when she takes off her glasses and sets them on my nightstand.

Not exactly a compliment when a chick takes off her glasses before sex.

Please change your mind. Please change your mind.

I chew on my lower lip while shuffling my feet on the floor. My heart has never beat so hard. I’m sure I look frenzied as fuck.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

vI can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

I pull back, noticing I’m still giving her some of my weight, and rise. I grab my boxer briefs, go to my bathroom to get rid of the condom in the trash, and turn on the light when I return to my bedroom.

Carolina pulls the sheets up her chest before sitting up while I tug on my briefs.

“Oh my God!” she suddenly gasps, her hand flying to her mouth.

My attention moves to what she’s looking at.

Blood on the sheets.

It’s not a lot, but it’s there.

“It’s fine,” I say gently. “I’ll throw them in the wash. No big deal.”

“What … what about your mom?” she stutters out.

“I’ll do them myself. She won’t even see, and if she does, I won’t tell her it was you.”

She nods.

I bend down and kiss her forehead. “Like it never happened.”

“Like it never happened,” she repeats.

I just took my best friend’s virginity.

And now, I’m supposed to act like it wasn’t the best fucking moment of my life.

I can’t believe we’re doing this.

I grab her hips, tilting them up, and gently slide inside her.

I can’t stop myself from groaning.

Fuck. She feels like heaven.

I slide in deeper and stop. “You good?”

She nods, forcing a small smile even though I can sense her pain.

I move again. “Still good?”

Another nod, tension clear on her face.

I halt. “Switch spots with me.”

She winces. “Huh?”

“It’ll be less painful if you’re on top. You can control how much of me you take,” I explain, slowly pulling out of her.

She reaches forward and grabs me around the back, her nails digging into my skin to stop me from moving. “I can’t … get on top of you.” She gestures to our connection with her free hand. “This is fine. We’ll stay like this.”

My voice softens. “Tell me if you change your mind or if it hurts too much.”

I notice a faint smile on her lips, and her hand briefly rubs my back before dropping.

“I trust you, Rex. I trust you more than anyone.”

I softly squeeze her hips and thrust all the way in, causing her back to arch and a gasp to leave her. I stop again, giving her time to adjust to my size, and I gulp as her tightness overwhelms me.

My head spins while I slowly push in and out of her. My pace is not only to lessen her pain. I’m also fighting to stop myself from busting inside her in seconds. I smile like a motherfucker when I notice it’s starting to feel good for her. Her hips move up to meet mine, and she moans.

I want to run my hands up her stomach, push up her bra, and play with her breasts, but I can’t. This is purely sex. Nothing more. So, I play with her clit instead.

She moans again, setting me off.

My face goes to her neck as I quicken my thrusts.

I hold back from telling her how fucking perfect she feels.

How tight she is.

How much I love being inside her.

My hips jerk, and I move faster yet also cautiously, still not wanting to hurt her. I’m close to reaching my brink, but I need to make her feel good. I rotate my hips and mentally give myself a high five when a high-pitched moan leaves her, and she grinds against me.

It’s somewhat of an orgasm.

Not a full yell-out-my-name one, but there’s more pleasure there than pain.

This is when I can’t stop myself from bucking forward faster. Shocking us both, I smash my mouth to hers as I come. My lips move from hers to her ear, sprinkling kisses along the way, and I bury my face in her neck.

“Fuck, Lina,” I groan, exploding into the condom, shivering.

My hands rest at each side of her head as I pull back, and I glance down at her, both of us catching our breaths.

Her lips tilt into a shy smile. “Thank you.”

I return the smile. “It was my pleasure.”

It was a bad idea, but I love that I was her first.

That she gave me that.

I also hate her for it.

Now, I know what it feels like to be inside her.

No matter what she said, our relationship will change.

Carolina has ruined other girls for me, but I have to fight it.

We can’t have that type of relationship.

“Now, I can’t breathe,” she says with an awkward laugh, breaking me away from my thoughts.
